# TVOutColor_Minimal_FSC

stripped down to the core in hopes of later repurposing as a framebuffer
file size has been cut down to <3kb, more work needs to be done.

only tested on Uno board + Arduino version 1.0.6 so far

# done:
    get rid of way too many files
    get rid of everything except FSC

# to do:
    get rid of CINT class generate everything procedurally
